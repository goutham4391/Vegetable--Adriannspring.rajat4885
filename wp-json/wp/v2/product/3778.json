It is descended from the wild cabbage and is closely related to broccoli and cauliflower Brussels sprouts and savoy cabbage which are sometimes called cole crops. Cabbage heads generally range from 0.5 to 4 kilogrammes (1 to 9 lb), and can be green, purple and white. Smooth-leafed firm-headed green cabbages are the most common, with smooth-leafed red and crinkle-leafed Savoy cabbages of both colors seen more rarely. It is a multi-layered vegetable.
